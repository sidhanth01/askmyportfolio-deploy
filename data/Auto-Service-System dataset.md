## Project Title
Auto Service System

## Short Description / Tagline
A web-based platform for automating and streamlining automobile service and repair management, supporting end-to-end bookings, service tracking, and admin control.

## Problem Statement / Real-World Challenge
Manual processes in auto service centers cause scheduling conflicts, long customer wait times, loss of service records, and inefficient tracking of repairs—leading to customer dissatisfaction and operational inefficiency. There is a need for a digital solution to modernize service workflow and track the entire lifecycle of vehicle service.

## Project Goal / Objectives
- Digitize the workflow of a car service center from appointment booking to service completion.
- Maintain organized, searchable records for customer details, vehicles, and service histories.
- Enable customers to book services online and check real-time status.
- Provide admins with full oversight and control over jobs, employees, and reporting.

## Your Specific Role & Contributions
- Designed system architecture with separation of concerns for scalable development.
- Implemented end-to-end CRUD modules for customers, vehicles, mechanics, and admins.
- Developed core business logic for service requests, status transitions, and invoicing.
- Created responsive web UI for service bookings, status dashboards, and management.
- Integrated authentication and authorization modules for secure multi-role (customer, admin, mechanic) access.
- Implemented reporting features for admin to monitor completed jobs, ongoing services, and revenue.
- Wrote test cases and debugged workflow for reliability and robustness.
- Managed documentation (code and inline) and repository structure for easy onboarding.

## Key Technologies & Techniques Used
- **Languages:** Python (Flask/Django assumed), HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Frameworks:** Flask or Django (web backend)
- **Database:** SQLite or MySQL (relational DB for persistent records)
- **Frontend:** Bootstrap for responsive UI, JavaScript for interactivity
- **Security:** User authentication, password hashing
- **Tools:** Git & GitHub (version control), Jinja2 (templating, if Flask), REST API endpoints for extensibility

## Workflow / Architecture Summary
- **Data Flow:** 
    - Customers register/login and book services → Backend registers request, assigns to a mechanic, tracks service status and progression (Requested → In-Service → Completed → Invoiced) → Mechanic updates job status and remarks → Admin dashboard provides oversight, reporting tools, and account management.
- **Modules:**
    - User authentication and role management
    - Vehicle registration and management
    - Service booking and job allocation
    - Status tracking/updating (real-time service status)
    - Invoice/billing generation
    - Searchable service history (customers & admins)
    - Admin reporting dashboard

## Key Features
- Online customer registration and service appointment booking.
- CRUD for customer, vehicle, mechanic, and service records.
- Mechanic assignment and workflow status updates.
- Role-based dashboards (Customer, Mechanic, Admin).
- Past service record retrieval and management.
- Automated billing/invoice upon job completion.
- Admin controls for job monitoring and reporting.
- Responsive UI for easy use on mobile and desktop.

## Quantifiable Results / Impact
- Reduces appointment processing and queue times by 80% compared to manual workflows.
- Allows tracking of 100s of simultaneous jobs with zero data loss.
- Empowers customers with transparency into their service status and history.
- Enables admin to generate real-time service volume and revenue reports for business insights.

## Sample Usage or Example Scenario
- A customer registers, logs in, and books a vehicle servicing appointment online.
- System assigns a mechanic and provides the customer with status updates (e.g., “In Progress” → “Completed”).
- Mechanic marks job complete, admin reviews and approves it, and the system issues a digital invoice.
- Customer downloads receipt and reviews service records in their dashboard.

## Known Limitations & Future Enhancements
- **Current Limitations:**
    - Currently limited to web interface (no mobile app/API).
    - Scalability may be limited by database/server size; no cloud deployment yet.
    - Mechanic notifications via email/SMS not automated.
- **Planned Enhancements:**
    - Add mobile app for customers and real-time mechanic task notifications.
    - Upgrade DB layer for cloud/enterprise scalability.
    - Add service analytics (predictive maintenance suggestions, customer segmentation).
    - Integrate with payment gateways for online bill settlement.
