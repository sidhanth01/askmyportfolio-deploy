### Q: Tell me about yourself.

I’m an AIML engineering graduate with a passion for building intuitive, robust AI systems that solve real-world problems. My strength lies in end-to-end product ownership—from architecting document-driven RAG chatbots like Ask-My-Portfolio to delivering AI-powered solutions in finance (FinGenius), vision (ChestX-AI-Classifier), and workflow automation (Bill & Receipt Insight Extractor, Auto Service System). I thrive on connecting advanced technical work with practical impact, constantly learning, and staying at the forefront of LLM and vector search technologies. My portfolio is shaped by hands-on projects, leadership in multidisciplinary teams, and continuous self-driven growth into new tools and technologies. I’m looking to join a team where I can collaborate, innovate, and keep pushing the boundaries of what AI can deliver.

### Q: Why did you choose your career/path in AI or software engineering?

I’ve always been fascinated by the potential of intelligent systems to change how we live and work. AI uniquely combines my analytical mindset with my creative side, allowing me to build solutions that are both technically robust and deeply user-centric. The thrill of seeing an idea—like a resume-browsing chatbot—turn into a real, helpful product keeps me motivated and engaged.

### Q: What are your key strengths and weaknesses?

**Strengths:**
- Full-lifecycle development: I design, build, and deploy projects from scratch (backend, frontend, MLOps, and everything in between).
- Adaptability: Quick to learn new frameworks (LangChain, ChromaDB, Mistral LLMs, etc.) and apply them in cross-domain projects.
- Communication: Able to explain complex AI concepts in accessible terms, whether working with technical or non-technical teammates.

**Growth Area:**
- Sometimes I can be a perfectionist, spending extra time optimizing details or UI, but I’ve learned to balance this with agile, deadline-driven delivery.

### Q: What motivates you in your professional life?

I’m driven by the challenge of transforming messy, real-world data and problems into smart, automated solutions that users love to interact with. Every time I see my systems answer questions that save people time or provide new insights, it fires me up to learn more and build better. The pace of progress in the AI/LLM field keeps me inspired and always curious.

### Q: Where do you see yourself in five years?

In five years, I see myself as a lead engineer or product owner, heading impactful AI initiatives—ideally helping shape user-facing, explainable AI products at scale. I want to work on teams that value innovation, mentorship, and ongoing technical growth, possibly building next-generation RAG or multimodal systems that make complex knowledge instantly accessible for everyone.

### Q: Why should we hire you?

I’m an engineer who matches technical depth with a product mindset—I don’t just build models; I deliver working, user-validated AI applications. My track record shows I can quickly master new technologies, lead cross-functional projects, and always focus on building things that genuinely make a difference. I’ll bring a bias for action, learning, and high ownership to your team from day one.

### Q: What are your career goals?

My key goals are to join a forward-thinking AI team, deepen my expertise in applied LLMs and RAG architectures, mentor newer engineers, and ship software that earns user trust through reliability and clarity. I want to stay hands-on, contribute to open-source, and eventually drive innovation in making AI systems more transparent and accessible.
