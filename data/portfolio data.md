## Project: Ask My Portfolio – AI-Powered Resume Q&A Chatbot

**Short Description:**  
Conversational assistant that answers questions about my resume, skills, and projects using RAG and LLMs, with semantic search over all portfolio content.

**Problem Statement:**  
Static resumes are inefficient for screening and often miss key skills; recruiters need a dynamic tool to query experience in natural language.

**Goal:**  
Let reviewers and collaborators ask plain English questions and get accurate, context-rich answers drawn directly from all of my actual documents.

**Role & Contributions:**  
- Designed and implemented complete RAG pipeline with data chunking, schema engineering, and retrieval.
- Used all-MiniLM-L6-v2 as the semantic embedding model.
- Deployed Mistral 7B LLM locally for fast, high-quality answer generation.
- Used ChromaDB for persistent vector search.
- Orchestrated all retrieval and generation via LangChain.
- Built and deployed Streamlit chat UI for local and cloud demo access.
- Enabled privacy-safe, zero-hosting-cost deployment.

**Technologies/Techniques:**  
Python, Mistral 7B, all-MiniLM-L6-v2, ChromaDB, LangChain, Streamlit

**Impact/Results:**  
- Transformed resume into an interactive chatbot, reducing recruiter screening time.
- Showcases advanced RAG, LLM, and system orchestration skills.
- Local and cloud operation; no API or third-party data exposure.

**Key Features:**
- Natural language Q&A
- Contextual retrieval and answer construction
- Robust semantic search, privacy-first
- Demo link and local app support

**Example Usage:**
Recruiter asks, "Which of your projects uses computer vision?"  
Chatbot: "The Chest-X AI Classifier uses a custom CNN and OpenCV to automate COVID-19 detection from X-rays, achieving over 90% accuracy."

## Project: FinGenius – AI-Powered Financial Advisory Platform

**Short Description:**  
Smart chatbot for personalized investment recommendations and market insights.

**Problem Statement:**  
Conventional financial advice is static and generic.

**Goal:**  
Deliver a dynamic AI-based advisor providing tailored finance guidance in real time.

**Role & Contributions:**  
- Built domain-specific chatbot, NLP/intent workflows, backend (Node.js, Firebase).
- Integrated logic-driven recommendations, real-time feeds, and downloadable user resources.

**Technologies:**  
Python, JavaScript, Node.js, Botpress, Firebase, REST APIs

**Results:**
