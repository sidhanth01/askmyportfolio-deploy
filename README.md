# Ask-My-Portfolio

### An AI-powered chatbot that intelligently answers questions about my professional portfolio and projects.

This project is deployed as a live, interactive demo on Streamlit Community Cloud, showcasing a seamless end-to-end RAG application.

## ‚ú® Key Features

* **Interactive Q&A:** A user-friendly Streamlit chatbot interface for natural language queries.
* **Context-Aware Responses:** The model provides answers based solely on my resume and other professional documents, preventing fabrication of information.
* **Advanced RAG Pipeline:** Employs a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to ensure responses are accurate and relevant.
* **LLM Flexibility:** Utilizes a local LLM (Ollama's Mistral) for development with a cloud-based fallback (Hugging Face Hub) for reliable deployment.
* **Resume Integration:** A sidebar displays my resume directly within the application, allowing for simultaneous viewing and interaction.
* **Chat History Download:** Users can download a full transcript of the conversation in both PDF and plain text formats.
* **Modular Data Ingestion:** The project's knowledge base can be easily updated by adding new documents to the `data/` folder.
